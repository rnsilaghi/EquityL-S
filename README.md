Who or what you worked with on this homework (including generative AI like ChatGPT): ChatGPT
If you worked with generative AI also add a statement for how you used it.  

We used ChatGPT for debugging all of our files other than config.py. We also used it to create our database structure in db.py. We also used it to make sure our variables are unique. We also used it to understand packages like datetime and delta. We also used it for some SQL commands like insert or ignore. We also used it for help for limiting our API call. We also used it for methods like .isoformat(). We also used it to give us print statements to use in debugging. Lastly, we used it for date related methods like .strftime().
