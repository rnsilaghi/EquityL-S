Who or what you worked with on this homework (including generative AI like ChatGPT): ChatGPT
If you worked with generative AI also add a statement for how you used it.  

I used ChatGPT for all of the OS extensions which were necessary for my code to work on my local workstation. I also used it to know the default response of OMDB, to debug update cache, get_highest_box_office, and get_genres_above_cutoff. I also used it for the general structure and debugging of recommend similar movies. I als used it for help with the query creation.
